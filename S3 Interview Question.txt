1. What is Amazon S3?

	Simple Storage Service is a scalable and secure cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
	It allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

2. What are S3 buckets?

	S3 buckets are containers for storing objects (files) in Amazon S3. Each bucket has a unique name globally across all of AWS.

3. Why use S3 buckets?

	S3 buckets provide a reliable and highly scalable storage solution for various use cases. They are commonly used for backup and restore,
	data archiving, content storage for websites, and as a data source for big data analytics.

 
4. Key benefits of S3 buckets

	S3 buckets offer several advantages, including:

	Durability and availability: S3 provides high durability and availability for your data.
	
	Scalability: You can store and retrieve any amount of data without worrying about capacity constraints.
	
	Security: S3 offers multiple security features such as encryption, access control, and audit logging.
	
	Performance: S3 is designed to deliver high performance for data retrieval and storage operations.
	
	Cost-effective: S3 offers cost-effective storage options and pricing models based on your usage patterns.


5. Creating an S3 bucket

	To create an S3 bucket, you can use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI (Command Line Interface), or AWS SDKs (Software Development Kits). 
	You need to specify a globally unique bucket name and select the region where you want to create the bucket.

6. Choosing a bucket name and region

	The bucket name must be unique across all existing bucket names in Amazon S3. It should follow DNS naming conventions, 
	be 3-63 characters long, and contain only lowercase letters, numbers, periods, and hyphens. 
	The region selection affects data latency and compliance with specific regulations.


7. Versioning: 
	Versioning allows you to keep multiple versions of an object in the bucket. 
	It helps protect against accidental deletions or overwrites.

8. Uploading objects to S3 buckets

	You can upload objects to an S3 bucket using various methods, including the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, SDKs, and direct HTTP uploads. 
	Each object is assigned a unique key (name) within the bucket to retrieve it later.

9. Object metadata and properties

	Object metadata contains additional information about each object in an S3 bucket. 
	It includes attributes like content type, cache control, encryption settings, and custom metadata. 	
	These properties help in managing and organizing objects within the bucket.

10. File formats and object encryption

	S3 supports various file formats, including text files, images, videos, and more. You can encrypt objects stored in S3 using server-side encryption (SSE). 
	SSE options include SSE-S3 (Amazon-managed keys), SSE-KMS (AWS Key Management Service), and SSE-C (customer-provided keys).

4. What are S3 storage classes? 

     S3 Intelligent-Tiering:
 	It is most suitable for data with access needs that are either changing or unknown. S3 
	Intelligent-Tiering has four different access tiers: Frequent Access, Infrequent Access 
	(IA), Archive and Deep Archive. Data is automatically moved to the most inexpensive 
	storage tier according to customer access patterns. 

     S3 Standard:
 	It is suitable for frequently accessed data that needs to be delivered with low latency 
	and high throughput. S3 Standard targets applications, dynamic websites, content 
	distribution and big data workloads. 

     S3 Standard-IA:
 	It offers a lower storage price for data that is needed less often but that must be quickly 
	accessible. This tier can be used for backups and long-term data storage. 

     S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval:
 	Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is an archive storage class that delivers the lowest- 
	cost storage for long-lived data that is rarely accessed and requires retrieval in 
	milliseconds. With S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, you can save up to 68% on storage 
	costs compared to using the S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage 
	class, when your data is accessed once per quarter. 

     S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval:
 	S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval delivers low-cost storage, up to 10% lower cost (than S3 
	Glacier Instant Retrieval), for archive data that is accessed 1—2 times per year and is 
	retrieved asynchronously. 
	S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval delivers the most flexible retrieval options that balance 
	cost with access times ranging from minutes to hours and with free bulk retrievals. 

     S3 Glacier Deep Archive:
 	S3 Glacier Deep Archive is Amazon S3’s lowest-cost storage class and supports long- 
	term retention and digital preservation for data that may be accessed once or twice in a 
	year. It is designed for customers—particularly those in highly-regulated industries, 
	such as financial services, healthcare, and public sectors—that retain data sets for 7— 
	10 years or longer to meet regulatory compliance requirements 

     S3 One Zone-IA:
 	S3 One Zone-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access 
	when needed. Unlike other S3 Storage Classes which store data in a minimum of three 
	Availability Zones (AZs), S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single AZ and costs 20% 
	less than S3 Standard-IA. 
	Use of S3 One Zone-IA is indicated for infrequently accessed data without high 
	resilience or availability needs, data that is able to be recreated and backing up on- 
	premises data. 

     S3 Outposts:
 	It adds S3 object storage features and APIs to an on-premises AWS Outposts 
	environment. S3 Outposts is best used when performance needs call for data to be stored 
	near on-premises applications or to satisfy specific data residency requirements


11. Lifecycle management

	Lifecycle management allows you to define rules for transitioning objects between different 
	storage classes or deleting them automatically based on predefined criteria. 
	
	For example, you can move infrequently accessed data to a lower-cost storage class after a specified time 
	 or delete objects after a certain retention period.

12. Multipart uploads

	Multipart uploads provide a mechanism for uploading large objects in parts, which improves performance and resiliency. 
	You can upload each part in parallel and then combine them to create the complete object. 
	Multipart uploads also enable resumable uploads in case of failures.

13. Managing large datasets with S3 Batch Operations

	S3 Batch Operations is a feature that allows you to perform bulk operations on large numbers of objects in an S3 bucket. 
	It provides an efficient way to automate tasks such as copying objects, tagging, and restoring archived data.



14. Is there a way to upload a file that is greater than 100 MB in Amazon S3?
 
 	Yes, it is possible by using multipart upload utility from AWS. With multipart
 	upload utility, larger files can be uploaded in multiple parts that are uploaded
 	independently. You can also decrease upload time by uploading these parts in
 	parallel. After the upload is done, the parts will be merged into a single object
 	or file to create the original file from which the parts were created.

15. What is the difference between S3 and S3 Glacier?
	 S3 is used for general, high-speed storage accessible at any time, suitable for a wide
	 range of applications including websites, mobile apps, and backups. 

	 S3 Glacier is a lower-cost storage service optimized for data archiving and long-term backup, where
	 retrieval times of several minutes to hours are acceptable.

16. Explain the S3 Lifecycle Policies.
 	Lifecycle policies in S3 are used to manage your objects automatically as they transition
 	to different stages of their lifecycle. Policies can be used to transition objects to less
 	expensive storage classes or schedule objects for automatic deletion after certain
 	periods, helping reduce costs by managing data according to its lifecycle.

 17. HowdoesS3Encryption work?

 	S3 provides two means of encryption:
	
	-> Server-Side Encryption (SSE): 
		Where Amazon handles the encryption process, the decryption, and key management. 
			You can choose among three keys management options: 
			
			(1) SSE-S3 (uses keys managed by S3), 
			(2) SSE-KMS (uses AWS Key Management Service), 
			(3) SSE-C (where you manage the encryption keys).

	-> Client-Side Encryption: Your data is encrypted on the client side before uploading it to S3.

18. What is the minimum and maximum size of individual objects that you can store in S3?
 
	The minimum size of individual objects that you can store in S3 is 0 bytes and the maximum 
	bytes that you can store for individual objects is 5TB.  

19. What is the default storage class in S3?  
	Answer: The default storage class in S3 in Standard frequently accessed. 

20. What is glacier?  
	Answer: Glacier is the backup or archival tool that you use to back up your data in S3.

21. How can you secure the access to your S3 bucket?  
	Answer: There are two ways that you can control the access to your S3 buckets,  
	• ACL – Access Control List  
	• Bucket polices 

22. How can you encrypt data in S3?  
	Answer: You can encrypt the data by using the below methods,  
	• Server Side Encryption – S3 (AES 256 encryption)  
	• Server Side Encryption – KMS (Key management Service) 
	• Server Side Encryption – C (Client Side)

23. What are the parameters for S3 pricing?  
	Answer: The pricing model for S3 is as below,  
	• Storage used  
	• Number of requests you make  
	• Storage management  
	• Data transfer  
	• Transfer acceleration  

24. What is the pre-requisite to work with Cross region replication in S3?  
	Answer: You need to enable versioning on both source bucket and destination to work with cross 
	region replication. Also both the source and destination bucket should be in different region. 

25. What is the maximum individual archive that you can store in glacier?  
	Answer: You can store a maximum individual archive of upto 40 TB.

26. One of my s3 is bucket is deleted but i need to restore is there any possible way?  
	Answer: If versioning is enabled we can easily restore them  

27. what are the things we need to remember while creating s3 bucket?  
	Answer:  
	• Amazon S3 and Bucket names are  
	• This means bucket names must be unique across all AWS  
	• Bucket names can contain upto 63 lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens and  
	• You can create and use multiple buckets  
	• You can have upto 10,000 per account by 

28. Explain Amazon s3 lifecycle rules?  
	Answer: Amazon S3 lifecycle configuration rules, you can significantly reduce your storage costs by 
	automatically transitioning data from one storage class to another or even automatically delete data 
	after  a period of time.  
	• Store backup data initially in Amazon S3 Standard  
	• After 30 days, transition to Amazon Standard IA  
	• After 90 days, transition to Amazon Glacier  
	• After 3 years, delete 

29. What is the maximum file length in S3?  
	Answer: utf-8 1024 bytes 

30. Can objects in Amazon s3 be delivered through amazon cloud front?  
	Answer:Yes
